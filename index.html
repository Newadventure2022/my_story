                title="Link to Trader Joe's" target="_blank">
                Trader Joe’s</a>, a popular grocery store in the USA. It was a good job, but I
            wanted to do
            something more
            fulfilling. I wanted to build a career. My husband James kept telling me I should try coding because I
            have the brain
            for it. I did not consider it because I was already studying to get a degree in Business Management, and I
            was working
            full-time at Trader Joe’s.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">When the pandemic hit California in 2020, everything changed. Working at Trader Joe’s was
            extremely
            stressful. While
            many people were allowed to work from home, that option was not available for me as a store manager. I had
            to go in five
            days a week and deal with the concerns of the customers and crew.</p>

        <p class="mt-5">One day James and I were talking about how we needed to make a change. We decided we would move
            to Spain. We
            had
            planned on making the move in 5-10 years, but since the pandemic hit, we were ready to go. James could
            keep his job
            and move abroad. I had to think of a new career. I decided to teach English as a second language, which
            meant I
            needed to study for my TEFL certification. I found the <a class="tefl-link"
                href="https://www.internationalteflacademy.com/lp-referral-program?grsf=iqs50i"
                title="Link to International TEFL Academy" target="_blank">
                International Tefl Academy</a>, and began the year-long
            process of
            getting certified. I received my certificate in December of 2020.</p>
        <p class="pb-5">
            Our next task was planning the big move. The world was in lockdown, and moving abroad did not seem possible.
            The only
            thing we could do was research how to move to another country, where to go, and how we could fly with our
            dogs. Moving
            abroad with dogs is no easy task. That will be a story for another time.

                I cannot remember the day I saw the news, but it said that on June 7, 2021, Spain would allow people to
                enter Spain!! That was the sign I was looking for since my birthday is on June 7th.

            <p class="mb-5">
                We decided to leave California on August 16, 2021. We sold almost everything we owned, gave tons of
                stuff away
                (including my Volkswagen Beetle to my mother), and said our goodbyes to our dear family and friends.

                We arrived in Madrid on August 17, 2020. We could not believe we actually did it! We moved to Spain!!!!

                After a few weeks of getting settled and finding a new apartment it was time to get to business.
                I needed to get
                my Spanish Residency and permission to work. The residency process took over two years (again, that is a
                story for
                another time).
                Luckily, I was allowed to work while my residency application was in process because I am married to an
                EU Citizen.

                Long story short, I was hired at an academy teaching English. My first year was quite the experience,
                and although there are aspects that I enjoy about teaching, I have come to terms with the fact that
                teaching English isn’t my passion. Instead, I found coding fulfills my need to solve problems and create
                beautiful things. It's a win-win!

                I saw an advert for <a class="sheCodes-link" href="https://www.shecodes.io" title="Link to SheCodes.io"
                    target="_blank">
                    SheCodes
                </a> one day in the Summer of 2022.
                <a class="sheCodes-link" href="https://www.shecodes.io/free-class" title="Link to SheCodes Free Class"
                    target="_blank">
                    "Free coding class for Beginners"
                </a>is what
                the ad stated. I
                thought, why not try it. I signed up for the free webinar and loved it. Of course, my husband said, “I
                knew you would
                love it. You should have listened to me when I told you to take up coding years ago!” Ha ha ha! He was
                not wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I signed up for more lessons after taking the free course, and little by little, I completed each course
                until I achieved the Frontend Developer Certification.

                Along the way, I built a Weather app, Dictionary app, Travel app, World clock, and much more.

                has been over one
                year of learning and growing, and it's been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. Matt
                Delac and his
                SheCodes team have been wonderfully supportive. Thank you, Matt, for starting your company and
                helping over 180,000 students
                (as of today) learn to code. I am happy to be one of the many women from 191 countries who have
                learned to code from you and your
                team. I already have freelance work building a couple of websites, and I am excited to grow our Three
                Gloves business with my husband, James.
                For anyone hoping
                to take their
                career in a new direction, I highly recommend learning to code with SheCodes. The <a
